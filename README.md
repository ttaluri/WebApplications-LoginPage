# Login Page Description

This is a simple login page with a hero image in the background. The login form is positioned in the center of the hero image. The form contains two fields: username and password, and two buttons: Submit and Clear. The text on the page has a yellow background and is styled with the Comic Sans MS font. When the Submit button is hovered over, its background color changes to light gray and its text color changes to black. When the form is submitted, the default form submission behavior is prevented, the content of the page changes to "Login Successful", and the page reloads after 5 seconds.
